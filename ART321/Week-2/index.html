			<h2> What is Computer Science? </h2>
			<p>
			Despite the name, computer science is not the simply study of computers, but rather it is the study of the mathematical theory, 
			logical concepts, and engineering behind the architecture and usage of computers. 
			Computer Science is an incredibly broad, and dynamic field. At the University of Calgary alone, there are 9 specializations
			within the department of Computer Science. </br>

					<h3> Algorithm and Complexity Theory</h3>
					<p style="border-right: 1px solid #000000; padding-right:30px;"> This concentration is heavily leaning towards the mathemtics aspect of computer science.
					The main focus of this field is to study algorithms, analytical thought, first order logic, and various aproaches to 
					problem solving. </br>

					<h3> Computer Game Design </h3>
					<p style="border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left:30px;"> 
					This concentration is arguably on of the more broad concentrations. Computer Game Design is a multidisciplnary
					field requiring knowledge in physics, mathematics, fine art, communication studies, as well as foundational computer
					science knowledge. As the name implies, the aim of this field is to develop games to be played on computers.

					<h3> Computer Graphics</h3>
					<p style="border-right: 1px solid #000000; padding-right:30px;">  
					Computer graphics is an incredibly flexible field of study within computer science. Knowledge in this field includes various methods of modelling, simulations, and various algorithms.
					This knowledge can then be used to serve a multitude of different functions such as gaming, animation, film, and so on.

					<h3> Human Computer Interactions </h3>
					<p style="border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left:30px;"> 
					Human Computer Interaction bridges data and information, with groups and individuals. The aim of this field is to understand the 
					need's of a system's users in order to create software that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective. In essence HCI is 
					built on the idea of understanding people and building software based on that understanding.

					<h3> Information Security</h3>
					<p style="border-right: 1px solid #000000; padding-right:30px;">  
					Information security deals with, as the name implies, the security of information but in the context of a computer systems environment.
					This includes the study of cryptography, viruses, network security, and so on. As such, this field also involves general computer science 
					knowledge and mathematics.

					<h3> Networks and Distributed Computing </h3>
					<p style="border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left:30px;"> 
					This field of Computer Science deals with systems involving multiple computers. It is concerned with network communication, parallel computation as well as various 
					types of networks. These can include peer-to-peer, wireless internet, sensor networks, and so on. In short, Networks and Distributed Computing aims to design and analyze
					multi-computer sytems.
