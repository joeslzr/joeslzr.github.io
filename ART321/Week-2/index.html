			<h2> What is Computer Science? </h2>
			<p>
			Despite the name, computer science is not the simply study of computers, but rather it is the study of the mathematical theory, 
			logical concepts, and engineering behind the architecture and usage of computers. 
			Computer Science is an incredibly broad, and dynamic field. At the University of Calgary alone, there are 9 specializations
			within the department of Computer Science. </br>

					<h3> Algorithm and Complexity Theory</h3>
					<p style="border-right: 1px solid #000000; padding-right:30px;"> This concentration is heavily leaning towards the mathemtics aspect of computer science.
					The main focus of this field is to study algorithms, analytical thought, first order logic, and various aproaches to 
					problem solving. </br>

					<h3> Computer Game Design </h3>
					<p style="border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left:30px;"> 
					This concentration is arguably on of the more broad concentrations. Computer Game Design is a multidisciplnary
					field requiring knowledge in physics, mathematics, fine art, communication studies, as well as foundational computer
					science knowledge. As the name implies, the aim of this field is to develop games to be played on computers.

					<h3> Computer Graphics</h3>
					<p style="border-right: 1px solid #000000; padding-right:30px;">  
					Computer graphics is an incredibly flexible field of study within computer science. Knowledge in this field includes various methods of modelling, simulations, and various algorithms.
					This knowledge can then be used to serve a multitude of different functions such as gaming, animation, film, and so on.
