		<h1 style="margin-bottom:35px;"> What are Deep-fried Memes? </h1>
		<p style="margin-bottom:-45px;">Deep-fried memes are believed to have originated around 2015. They were characterized
			as comical overfiltered images of pop culture icons like various disney characters and Spongebob Squarepants.
			The idea is that, as popular images and memes spread across social media sites,
			the images get repeatedly compressed, and their quality degrades. The process of deep-frying
			is essentially a parody of this phenomenon by over exaggerating the constant degradation
			of the images to the point where they are barely recognizable. As they evolved, emojis
			were added as a sort of irony to further poke fun at social media culture. </br></br>

			The result is a new subculture of memes where the images are on the border of abstract.</br></br>
			Some examples:
